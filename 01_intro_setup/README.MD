## How To Run in development

Move to the root of the project and run the following commands

```javascript
npm run start:dev
```

to start the server

```bash

```

```javascript
 npm run build to start
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello world
```


```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
